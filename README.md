# Machine Learning Package "mikropml" Practice

## Description

This is a practice project to bring some interesting new things to my boring lockdown life...

Credit to the [mikropml package](http://www.schlosslab.org/mikropml/) developed by the Schloss Lab. In the practice project, I followed along with Dr. Schloss through his [Youtube video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxErFMF7BJY).
